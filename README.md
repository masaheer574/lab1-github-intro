# Hi, I'm Masaheer 👋

## About Me
My name is Masaheer, and I am a Level 6 student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I have a strong interest in technology and problem-solving, and I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems can learn from data and make meaningful decisions.

I am particularly interested in Machine Learning because it plays a key role in many real-world applications such as data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive systems. I look forward to developing my skills in this field and applying them to practical and impactful projects.
